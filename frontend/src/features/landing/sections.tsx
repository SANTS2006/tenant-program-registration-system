    q: "Who can see the registrations we collect?",
    a: "Only the people in your account you've given access to, plus the platform administrators who run the service. Every account is a private workspace, and other organizations on the platform can't see your programs, registrations, or team.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can applicants register from their phones?",
    a: "Yes. Registration forms are fully mobile-friendly, support file and photo uploads from the phone, and follow the device's light or dark mode.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can we run several programs at the same time?",
    a: "Yes. Each program has its own form, link, QR code, registration numbers, ID cards, tickets, analytics, and exports.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kinds of questions can a form include?",
    a: "23 types: short and long text, email, phone, numbers, currency, ratings, dates and times, date of birth, single and multiple choice, dropdowns, yes/no, country, gender, address, website links, consent, and image, PDF, or document uploads.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do ID card and ticket QR codes work?",
    a: "Each code links to a verification page for that registration. Scanning it with any phone camera shows who it belongs to and whether the registration is still valid, and the scan is added to the program's Verifications log with the time and, for signed-in team members, who scanned it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I give my team access?",
    a: "Invite teammates from the Team page as a program admin or viewer. They receive an email with their sign-in details, and you choose which programs each person can access.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do voting polls keep votes fair and private?",
    a: "Voters create a voter account and confirm their email with a code. When one vote per email is on, the system refuses a second vote for the same position, even from an address written a different way. Admins can see who voted, but never which candidate they chose.",
  },
  {
    q: "What can a business do on the platform?",
    a: "Each business gets an order page, order tracking with your own statuses, and branded invoices and receipts. Customers are emailed a confirmation and updates, and invoices and receipts can be emailed as PDFs or downloaded as pictures.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which invoice, quotation and receipt layouts are there?",
    a: "Fourteen: nine A4 styles (Classic, Modern, Minimal, Wave, Corner, Bold, Soft, Stripe and Diagonal), three landscape cash-book receipts and two narrow till slips with a barcode. Pick one, choose your colours, and every document prints, downloads and emails as a PDF.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I make business cards?",
    a: "Yes. Choose from eight two-sided designs, add the person, a photo and a QR code of your website, then print the card, save it as a PDF or pictures, or email the PDF to any address.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I limit a poll to people I have approved?",
    a: "Yes. Turn on verified voters and paste their emails. Anyone who is not on the list cannot create an account, sign in or vote.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I get my data out?",
    a: "Anytime. Every table, including registrations, orders, invoices, receipts, poll results, and voters, can be exported to Excel or CSV, and any uploaded file can be downloaded.",
